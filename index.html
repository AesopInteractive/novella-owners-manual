		<h3 id="setup"><strong>A) Theme Installation & Setup</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

		<p>Two ways to install. Pick your poison.</p>

		<p><strong>Easy Theme Installation (through WordPress)</strong></p>
		<ol>
			<li>Login to your WordPress administration area, and go to Themes-->Appearence</li>
			<li>At the top of the page, select the "Install Themes" tab</li>
			<li>Once you are here, select "Upload," then "Choose File" to locate novella.zip on your computer, and install</li>
		</ol>

		<p><strong>Not so Easy (FTP)</strong></p>
		<ol>
			<li>Place the folder labeled 'novella' into the /wp-content/themes/ directory using an FTP client of your choice</li>
			<li>Once uploaded, head into your WordPress administration area, and activate Novella under WordPress--->Themes</li>
			<li>Install the recommended plugins as directed by the notice after theme activation</li>
		</ol>

		<p><strong>Install Recommended Plugins</strong></p>
		<p>This theme was built for <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/aesop-story-engine/">Aesop Story Engine</a>, although it can be used without the plugin just as well. So, after installing and activating Novella, go ahead and install the Aesop Story Engine plugin. If you've accidentally dismissed the alert to install it, just head to Appearence--->Install Plugins, and you'll be able to install ASE within a couple of clicks.</p>

		<p>The plugin provides all of the core functionality for the story componenets, and Novella paints the picture and makes things look awesome. This means you can switch out themes without ever loosing your components!</p>

		<hr>

		<h3 id="customnotes"><strong>B) Important Info about Novella</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>Due to the custom nature of this theme, some component options are not available, or have been overriden entirely by the theme as directed by the design. The following components have been modified and will explain what options are not available.</p>

		<ul>
			<li><b>Image Component - </b>A lot of time was spent on the image components responsive nature. As a result the width of the component is overridden by the theme. We reccommend a size of 1200px in width. </li>
			<li><b>Parallax & Content Components</b> - The height option within these components are overridden with a fluid height system, making it a better fit for tablets and mobile. The colors of the content component background and text color are overridden by the theme. By default they take the Accent color below, then are overridden with each post accent color.</li>
			<li><b>Character Component</b>  - The width of this component is restricted to 300px.</li>
			<li><b>Quote Component</b> - The only options available for the quote component within Novella will be the quote, alignment, and cite. The rest of the options are overridden by the theme.</li>
		</ul>

		<hr>

		<h3 id="options"><strong>C) Theme Options</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

		<p>Options can be found under the "Novella" heading, within the WordPress theme customizer. You can get to the customizer within WordPress by going to Appearence-->Customize, or via the front of your site, using the WordPress administration bar up top. Hover over your sites name in the bar, and choose "customize."</p>

		<ul>
			<li><b>Link</b> - Specify a general color for the links on the site. This can be overriden on an individual post.</li>
			<li><b>Accent</b> - Specify a general color for the links on the site. This can be overriden on an individual post.<</li>
			<li><b>Footer Text</b> - Control the footer text.</li>
			<li><b>Parallax Header</b> - Novella 1.0.4 introduces an option to toggle a parallax like effect for single posts that have a top featured image.</li>
		</ul>

		<hr>

		<h3 id="storydesign"><strong>D) Story Design</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>Each post or story in Novella has it's own individual "link" and "accent" color controls. The link color controls the color of teh anchor links in the post. The accent color will control the color of all Aesop Story Engine component caption backgrounds, including galleries.</p>


		<h3 id="sellstories"><strong>E) Sell Stories</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

		<p><b>Restrict Content Pro</b> - Sell story subscriptions with Restrict Content Pro, a premium third-party plugin (not included in Novella). Follow the directions for RCP and get a few level subscriptions setup. Then, go to an individual post and tick the box in RCP setting that says "Paid Only." The option to show the excerpt isn't needed but helpful if you wish to show a teaser.</p>

		<p><img src="assets/images/rcp.png"></p>

		<p>You'll also need to add the welcome message. Go to your WordPress admin, then the Restrict tab, and under Settings, choose "Messages". Add the following under the Premium Content Message.</p>

		<code style="margin-bottom:1rem;display:block;">
			&lt;h2&gt;Story Subscription&lt;/h2&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;To continue reading the rest of this story, sign up for a subscription below.&lt;/p&gt;
		</code>

		<p>You can of course change the text, but keep the H2 and P intact inless you're doing something custom. The only other thing you need to know, is that the "Subscribe" button is connected to the checkout page, which you set under the "General" tab in Restrict Content Pro settings.</p>

		<p>Novella provides styling support and a button for the checkout. RCP handles the rest!</p>

		<hr />

		<h3 id="storyhighlights"><strong>F) Story Highlights</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

		<p>Novella supports Aesop Story Highlights add-on. The only thing you should know about this add-on, is that the shortcode is automagically added to the page if you have highlights created. In other words, don't add the shortcode to the post, it happens automatically!</p>

		<hr >

		<h3 id="updates"><strong>G) Enable Automatic Updates</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

		<p>Whenever a new udpate is available for this theme, you'll be automatically notified and will be able to update to the new version automatically. To enable updates, the license key provided with your download must be entered and saved.</p>

		<ol>
			<li>Login to your WordPress administration area, and go to Appearence-->Novella License.</li>
			<li>Save your changes, and your theme will now be enabled to recieve automatic updates.</li>
		</ol>

		<hr>

		<h3 id="advanced"><strong>H) Advanced Usage</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

		<p>If you're reading this then it's assumed that you are a theme developer, and you understand what hooks, filters, and CSS preprocessors are. This theme has advanced functionality built-in, so read on to see how you can take advantage of this and make your life easy.</p>

		<h5 class="sub-heading">DevTools</h5>
		<p>Included in your download, is a folder called "DevTools." Inside this folder are two files; package.json, and Gruntfile.js. If you do not know what Grunt is, then just ignore these files. If you do know what Grunt is, and you use it with your workflow, then just drop these two files into the "assets" directory of Novella. After they are there, run your npm install to install the node depencies, and you'll then be set to start working with the core LESS files. </p>

		<p>I HIGHLY recommend first making a child theme, and copying over at least the assets directory so your changes will stay safe with theme updates.</p>

		<h5 class="sub-heading">LESS</h5>
		<p>The styles are built with LESS. They're built with LESS vs SASS because LESS is easier for new folks to learn, and it's syntax is shorter. Within the theme folder, you'll find the assets directory. Within the assets directory, you'll find the LESS and CSS directories. Inside the LESS directory, there's a folder called "source" which contains most of Twitter Boostrap 3.0. These files are then imported into the style.less file, where the rest of the sites styles live.</p>

		<p>The style.less file is compiled into the style.css file that's enqueued by the theme. It's highly recommended to use a CSS preprocessor like Codekit, or a task runner such as Grunt, to compile these files. It's also important to know that ALL of the sites colors, can be controlled via the variables.less file, located within assets/less/source directory. </p>

		<h5 class="sub-heading">Child Themes</h5>
		<p>Setting up a child theme is the recommended way of manipulating and changing the layout. This keeps your changes in tact when a new theme update is available. We have included both a style.css and a functions.php in the "novella child" folder. Setting up a child theme is as easy as pasting the following in a new style.css file, in a new theme.</p>

		<pre>
			/*
			    Theme Name: Novella Child
			    Theme URI:
			    Author:
			    Author URI:
			    Description: A child theme for Novella
			    Version: 1.0
			    License: GNU General Public License v2 or later
			    License URI: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html
			    Template: novella
			*/
		</pre>

		<p>Then set up a functions.php file to enqueue this stylesheet.</p>

		<pre>
			<?php
add_action( 'wp_enqueue_scripts', 'novella_child_theme_styles' );
function novella_child_theme_styles() {
    wp_enqueue_style( 'parent-style', get_template_directory_uri() . '/assets/css/style.css' );
    wp_enqueue_style( 'child-style', get_stylesheet_uri(), array( 'parent-style' ) );
}
		</pre>
